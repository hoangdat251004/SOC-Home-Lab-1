# SOC-Home-Lab-1

## Objective

The Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience is set up a small virtual LAB to simulate real-world logging and monitoring scenarios, where we will collect logs from Apache web server and Fortigate firewall and send them to Splunk for storage, analysis, visualization and alerting.

### Skills Learned

- Good knowledge of how SIEM systems work and how to use them effectively.
- Skilled in reviewing and understanding network activity logs.
- Capable of identifying and creating patterns or signs of cyberattacks.
- Well-developed critical thinking and problem-solving abilities for cybersecurity challenges.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis, in this lab I use Splunk.
- Firewall (Fortigate) to monitor, control traffic that incoming or outgoing and send to Splunk to analyse.
