# SOC-Home-Lab-1

## Objective

The Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience is set up a small virtual LAB to simulate real-world logging and monitoring scenarios, where we will collect logs from Apache web server and Fortigate firewall and send them to Splunk for storage, analysis, visualization and alerting.

### Skills Learned

- Good knowledge of how SIEM systems work and how to use them effectively.
- Skilled in reviewing and understanding network activity logs.
- Capable of identifying and creating patterns or signs of cyberattacks.
- Well-developed critical thinking and problem-solving abilities for cybersecurity challenges.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis, in this lab I use Splunk.
- Firewall (Fortigate) to monitor, control traffic that incoming or outgoing and send to Splunk to analyse.

## Steps

1. SETUP

I created 2 Ubuntu VM on VMware and give it name is Splunk_Server and Apache_Server

Then I assgin static ip for those 2 VM like this below

  *Assign static IP for 2 VM*


I also install Fortigate as a firewall to give more event to do

  *Seting up FotigateVM*

After that in Splunk_Server and Apache_Server I create a user name splunk to isolate the Splunk installation with the least privilege.

`useradd -s /bin/bash -d /opt/splunk -m splunk`

At the Splunk_SV VM I dowload the Splunk Enterprise at splunk website.

At the Apache_SV VM I dowload the Universal Forwarder.

Extract those file and run those Splunk and create account to use Splunk.

Now to recieve logs I need to add data-input to Splunk and config it.

Because in Splunk for normal account I cant forward data throught port with 3 digit so I redirect that port to another port to bypass this.

Also in the Apache Server we need to config to be albe to send log to Splunk.

First I need dowload and enable apache2. After do that I can access the default page like this.

I creat some traffic to that page to get some log

We can see realtime traffic at the file `access.log` in the apache2 log folder

Now to send those log to Splunk to analyze we need to config 2 file at the Apache Server like this.

Then restart to save config.

2. ANALYZE LOGS

Log in Splunk I can do a lot of actions with that logs like

  - Create Reports

  - Create Dashboards

  - Create Alerts
